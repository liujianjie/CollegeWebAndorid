"description":"Textfree gives you a real US phone number so you can text or call anyone, even if they don’t have the app. Textfree uses your data or Wi-Fi connection to keep you in touch with friends and family all over the globe—and with features like group messaging, picture messaging, international texting & calling, emoji, stickers and voicemail, it’s the only messaging app you’ll ever need. All for free. \n\nYOU CAN’T BEAT THE ORIGINAL\nTextfree was the first free texting app in the app store. True story. Since 2009, Textfree has helped millions of people stay connected with friends and family. Since then, a lot of new and nifty features were added, but one thing’s always remained the same—Textfree is the fastest, most reliable and easiest to use texting app out there.   \n\nSEND UNLIMITED FREE TEXTS & REAL MMS PICTURE MESSAGES\nWith Textfree you get free SMS texting, totally free and unlimited. And now, Textfree is the first free texting app enabled with real MMS picture messaging just like a carrier phone – no strange looking links. That means you can send picture messages to all your friends, even if they don’t have Textfree!\n\nREAL PHONE NUMBER INCLUDED\nNot many free texting apps let you choose a real phone number. But having your own local phone number means you can call your grandma’s landline, order a pizza, SMS any number, and of course, hit up all your friends, even if they don’t have a smartphone.\n\nTEXT FREE WITH GROUP MESSAGES\nTextfree is the perfect free texting app for group messaging with all your contacts. You can create groups, leave groups, add participants and let everyone be part of the conversation.\n\nFREE CALLING \nFree calling has never been better. Textfree-to-Textfree calling and any incoming calls are always free. Outbound calling minutes are easy to earn or super cheap to buy. Who doesn’t love free calling?\n\nTURN ANY DEVICE INTO A PHONE\nNo phone? No Problem. Text free has you covered. Textfree turns your iPod or iPad into a phone, so you can text and call for free. Plus, calls sound great over Wi-Fi.\n\n\nOPTIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n• Reserve Number ($4.99 monthly) - Keep your number from expiring (normally we reclaim in active numbers after 30-days)\n• Voicemail-To-Text ($4.99 monthly) - Get your voicemails transcribed and sent as a text message so you can read it at your convenience.\n• Remove Ads ($2.99 monthly) - This one, well, you get the idea.\n\n\nTERMS\n\nSubscriptions automatically billed monthly or annually to your iTunes Account and auto-renew, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payments are charged to your iTunes account upon confirmation of purchase. You can turn off auto-renew or manage subscriptions in your iTunes & App Store account settings. Cancellations take effect at the end of the active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period (where available) is forfeited when purchasing a subscription.\n\nPrivacy policy & terms of use: http://www.pinger.com/privacy-policy\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT STUFF\n• Emergency calls are not supported \n• Textfree is ad-supported\n• When roaming, additional carrier data charges may apply. Contact your carrier for details. \n• If your contacts aren’t on Textfree, they might have to pay regular carrier charges for texts and pictures. \n• Choose ringtones and text tones\n• Free texting to the US and 30+ countries.

"description":"THIS GAME IS LIFE-RUININGLY FUN!\nFrom the writers of The Simpsons, comes the city building game that lets you create your own living, breathing Springfield! When Homer accidently causes a meltdown that wipes out Springfield, it’s up to you to clean up his mess… we mean, help him rebuild it!\n                                                                                                                                                                                           Collect Your Favorite Characters                                                                                                                  \nHelp reunite Homer with his loved ones - Marge, Lisa, Maggie (and even sometimes Bart) – as well as his not so loved ones, like Ned Flanders. Re-populate Springfield with your favorite characters, from Barflies (Barney Gumble) to Wise Guys (Fat Tony). Add them all, we won’t judge! Dress your characters to the nines with options like Daredevil Bart or Lizard Queen Lisa, and relive scenes from your favorite episodes of The Simpsons!\n                                                                                                                                                                                                               Take Charge of Your Springfield\nCan’t control your own life? Now you can control the lives of the citizens of Springfield instead! Make Apu work ridiculously long shifts at the Kwik-E-Mart, have Moe smuggle illegal animals, or make Homer toil poolside all day… that last one might not be so bad.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                  Build Your Own Springfield\nThink Homer deserves to live next door to Moe’s? Or the monorail can survive a few more sharp twists and turns? Or Krustyland needs 40% more cartoon violence and 40% fewer health inspectors? Well you can finally make Springfield just the way you want it! Expand your town to the Waterfront, grow its businesses with the glamourous shops of Springfield Heights, and enjoy its sights, all with only a few taps.\n\nExperience Unique Simpsons Stories\nCatch exclusive animated scenes and new hilarious stories from the writers of The Simpsons. You know they’re good because they write for The Simpsons! Tapped Out is the most life-ruiningly fun Simpsons game you can play! \n                                                                                                                                                                                                      Always Something New for Your Favorite Town\nSpringfield might perpetually be on the verge of destruction, buy hey, at least it’s never boring. Whether it’s Halloween monster invasions, superheroes run amok, or chaos caused by one of Homer’s “great” ideas, you’ve got never-ending options to tap!\n\nRequires acceptance of EA’s Privacy & Cookie Policy and User Agreement.\nUser Agreement: terms.ea.com", "artistId":284800461, "artistName":"Electronic Arts", "genres":["Games", "Simulation", "Entertainment", "Adventure"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.ea.simpsonssocial.inc2", "formattedPrice":"Free", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseDate":"2012-03-01T05:09:24Z", "trackId":497595276, "trackName":"The Simpsons™: Tapped Out", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Electronic Arts Inc.", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":309545},

"description":"Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. Over 100 million active users in two and a half years.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 30,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.\n\n100% FREE & NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees. \n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.", "artistId":686450210, "artistName":"Telegram LLC", "genres":["Social Networking", "Productivity"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"ph.telegra.Telegraph", "formattedPrice":"Free", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "releaseDate":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z", "trackId":686449807, "trackName":"Telegram Messenger", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Digital Fortress LLC", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":41222},
